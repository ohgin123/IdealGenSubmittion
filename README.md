Basically what my code does is. 
1)Seperate Bracket Token and Numerics Token into one array and Operators involving outer most value(Outermost Brackets and Numerics not in bracket) is stored in different Array
2) Processing the inner most Bracket Values and then Propagating to upper most Bracket Values
3)Once Value propagated up. Just take the "outer most" token and perform arithmatic operations using Operators involving outer most value
4) Rest is explained in code
